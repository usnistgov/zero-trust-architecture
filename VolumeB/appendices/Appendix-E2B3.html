<h2>Build Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#build-architecture" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In this section we present the logical architecture of E2B3 relative to how it instantiates the reference architecture depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="../architecture.html#architecturefigure1"><span class="std std-ref">Architecture - Figure 1</span></a>. We also describe E2B3’s physical architecture and present message flow diagrams for some of its processes.</p>
<section id="logical-architecture">
<h3>Logical Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#logical-architecture" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#appendix-e2b3-figure1"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a> depicts the logical architecture of E2B3. The figure uses numbered arrows to depict the general flow of messages needed for a subject to request access to a resource and have that access request evaluated based on subject identity (both requesting user and requesting endpoint identity), user authorizations, and requesting endpoint health. It also depicts the flow of messages supporting periodic reauthentication of the requesting user and the requesting endpoint and periodic verification of requesting endpoint health, all of which must be performed to continually reevaluate access. The labeled steps in <a class="reference internal" href="#appendix-e2b3-figure1"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a> have the same meanings as they do in <a class="reference internal" href="../architecture.html#architecturefigure1"><span class="std std-ref">Architecture - Figure 1</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../architecture.html#architecturefigure2"><span class="std std-ref">Architecture - Figure 2</span></a>. However, <a class="reference internal" href="#appendix-e2b3-figure1"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a> includes the specific products that instantiate the architecture of E2B3. <em>Figure 1</em> also does not depict any of the resource management steps found in <a class="reference internal" href="../architecture.html#architecturefigure1"><span class="std std-ref">Architecture - Figure 1</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../architecture.html#architecturefigure2"><span class="std std-ref">Architecture - Figure 2</span></a> because the ZTA technologies deployed in E2B3 do not support the ability to perform authentication and reauthentication of the resource or periodic verification of resource health.</p>
<p>E2B3 was designed to have three PDPs: Cisco ISE, Cisco Secure Workload, and Ping Identity PingFederate. Ping Identity PingFederate also serves as the identity, access, and credential manager. PingFederate, Cisco Duo, Cisco network devices, and Cisco Secure Workload also serve as PEPs. Radiant Logic acts as a PIP for the PDP as it responds to inquiries and provides user identity and authentication information on demand in order for Ping Identity PingFederate to make near-real-time access decisions. VMware Workspace One UEM provides endpoint management, and Cisco Secure Endpoint provides endpoint protection. Cisco Duo provides second-factor user authentication. Note that both multifactor authentication and directory services are also available through Ping, but for purposes of this collaborative build, Ping is demonstrating standards-based interoperability by integrating with Cisco Duo for MFA and Radiant Logic RadiantOne for federated identity services. A more detailed depiction of the messages that flow among components to support a user access request can be found in <a class="reference internal" href="#e2b3-message-flows-for-resource-access-requests-non-compliant-endpoints-forbidden-access-requests-and-policy-discovery"><span class="std std-ref">E2B3 Message Flows for Resource Access Requests, Non-Compliant Endpoints, Forbidden Access Requests, and Policy Discovery</span></a>.</p>

<section id="icam-information-architecture">
<span id="appendix-e2b3-figure1"></span><h4>ICAM Information Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#icam-information-architecture" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>How ICAM information is provisioned, distributed, updated, shared, correlated, governed, and used among ZTA components is fundamental to the operation of the ZTA. The ICAM information architecture ensures that when a subject requests access to a resource, the aggregated set of identity information and attributes necessary to identify, authenticate, and authorize the subject is available to be used as a basis on which to make the access decision.</p>
<p>In E2B3, Ping Identity, Radiant Logic, and SailPoint integrate with each other as well as with other components of the ZTA to support the ICAM information architecture. The ways that these components work together to correlate identity information and to support actions such as users joining, changing roles, and leaving the enterprise are the same in E2B3 as they are in E2B1. These interactions are described in <a class="reference internal" href="Appendix-E2B1.html#e2b1icam"><span class="std std-ref">E2B1 - ICAM Information Architecture</span></a>.</p>

<h4>Authentication Message Flow for Mobile Endpoints (PingFederate, VMware Workspace ONE, Cisco Duo, Cisco Secure Endpoint, Cisco ISE, Cisco Secure Workload, and Radiant Logic)<a class="headerlink" href="#authentication-message-flow-for-mobile-endpoints-pingfederate-vmware-workspace-one-cisco-duo-cisco-secure-endpoint-cisco-ise-cisco-secure-workload-and-radiant-logic" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#appendix-e2b3-figure3"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 3</span></a> depicts the high-level message flow supporting the use case in which a subject who has an enterprise ID, is using a mobile device, and is authorized to access an enterprise resource, requests and receives access to that resource. In the case depicted here, access to the resource is protected by PingFederate, which acts as a PDP and is the centralized identity provider in the identity federation. In addition to performing its own user authentication, PingFederate is integrated with VMware Workspace ONE and delegates localized authentication of the mobile device and user to Workspace ONE. Workspace ONE manages the mobile endpoint, ensures that its certificate is valid, gathers device health information to ensure device compliance, performs remediation if possible, and then authenticates the user and device. After successfully authenticating the user and the device, Workspace ONE notifies PingFederate, which, as the centralized identity provider, determines what additional authentication must be performed, if any. In the use case depicted here, PingFederate oversees multifactor authentication of the user by requesting username and credentials, delegating initial authentication to Radiant Logic, and then asking Cisco Duo to perform second-factor user authentication. In addition, Cisco Secure Endpoint performs continuous endpoint threat detection, Cisco Secure Workload applies policies directly to the resource to protect it, and Cisco ISE acts as a PDP to enforce policy beyond user and device authentication.</p>
<p>The message flow depicted in <a class="reference internal" href="#appendix-e2b3-figure3"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 3</span></a> shows only the messages that are sent in response to the access request. However, the authentication and access process also rely on the following additional background communications that occur among components on an ongoing basis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>VMware Workspace ONE is integrated with PingFederate and Cisco ISE. Workspace ONE periodically sends Cisco ISE assurance that, based on device health information it is collecting, the mobile device is managed, has the unique certificate that was provisioned specifically for that device, and is compliant with configured policy (e.g., firewall running, anti-malware software enabled, iOS version correct). Workspace ONE may also provide this information to Ping as part of the authentication flow.</p></li>
<li><p>The Cisco Duo endpoint agent periodically syncs with the Cisco Duo cloud component to reauthenticate the requesting endpoint device using a unique certificate that has been provisioned specifically for that device, and sends the cloud component information about device health (e.g., firewall running, anti-malware software, iOS version).</p></li>
<li><p>Cisco Duo is integrated with PingFederate. During the authentication flow, Cisco Duo sends PingFederate assurance that, based on the device health information it has collected, the device is compliant with configured policy.</p></li>

<li><p>Cisco ISE acts as a PDP. It receives notifications from Cisco Secure Endpoint and VMware Workspace ONE and relies on telemetry information that they provide to it to make its access decisions. If Cisco Secure Endpoint detects a threat in the device posture and notifies ISE, ISE can shut down the port that the user is trying to reach. If VMware Workspace ONE determines that the device is out of compliance, is no longer managed, or does not have a valid certificate, and notifies ISE, ISE can shut down the target port until the device’s security posture can be remediated.</p></li>
