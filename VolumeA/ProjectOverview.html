<h2>Motivation for the Project<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation-for-the-project" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Protecting enterprise data and resources has become increasingly challenging. Many users need access from anywhere, at any time, from any device to support the organization’s mission. Data is created, stored, transmitted, and processed across different organizations’ environments, which are distributed across on-premises and multiple clouds to meet ever-evolving business use cases. It is no longer feasible to simply protect data and resources at the perimeter of the enterprise environment or to assume that all users, devices, applications, and services within it can be trusted.</p>
<p>A zero-trust architecture (ZTA) enables secure authorized access to assets—machines, applications and services running on them, and associated data and resources—whether located on-premises or in the cloud, for a hybrid workforce and partners based on an organization’s defined access policy. For each access request, ZTA explicitly verifies the context available at access time—this includes both static user profile information or non-person entity information such as the requester’s identity and role; and dynamic information such as geolocation, the requesting device’s health and credentials, the sensitivity of the resource, access pattern anomalies, and whether the request is warranted and in accordance with the organization’s business process logic. If the defined policy is met, a secure session is created to protect all information transferred to and from the resource. A real-time, risk-based assessment of resource access and access pattern anomaly detection with continuous policy evaluation are performed to establish and maintain the access. A ZTA can also protect organizations from non-organizational resources that their users and applications may connect to, helping to stop threats originating from outside of the organization’s control.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate various ZTA implementations. NCCoE is collaborating with ZTA technology providers to build numerous example ZTA solutions and demonstrate their ability to meet the tenets of ZTA described in NIST SP 800-207. The goal of the solutions is to enforce corporate security policy dynamically and in near-real-time to restrict access to authenticated, authorized users, devices, and non-person entities while flexibly supporting a complex set of diverse business outcomes involving both remote and on-premises workforces, use of the cloud, partner collaboration, and support for contractors. The example solutions are designed to demonstrate the ability to protect against and detect attacks and malicious insiders. They showcase the ability of ZTA products to interoperate with existing enterprise and cloud technologies while trying to minimize impact on end-user experience.</p>
<p>The project can help organizations plan how to evolve their existing enterprise environments to ZTA, starting with an assessment of their current resources, strengths, and weaknesses, and setting mile-stones along a path of continuous improvement, gradually bringing them closer to achieving the ZTA goals they have prioritized based on risk, cost, resources, and their unique mission. The goal is to ena-ble organizations to thoughtfully apply ZTA controls that best protect their business while enabling them to operate as they need to.</p>

<h2>Challenges in Implementing ZTA<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-in-implementing-zta" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Throughout this project, numerous challenges organizations may face in implementing ZTA have been identified, including the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Organization buy-in and support, such as:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Perception that ZTA is suited only for large organizations and requires significant investment rather than understanding that ZTA is a set of guiding principles suitable for organizations of any size</p></li>
<li><p>Concern that ZTA might negatively impact the operation of the environment or end-user experience</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of resources to develop necessary policies and a pilot or proof-of-concept implementation needed to inform a transition plan</p></li>
<li><p>Leveraging existing investments and balancing priorities while making progress toward a ZTA via modernization initiatives</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of understanding regarding what additional skills and training administrators, security personnel, operators, end users, and policy decision makers may require</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Missing foundational pieces, such as:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lack of adequate asset inventory and management needed to fully understand the business applications, assets, and processes that need to be protected, with no clear understanding of the criticality of these resources</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of adequate digital definition, management, and tracking of user roles across the organization needed to enforce fine-grained, need-to-know access policy for specific applications and services</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of visibility of the organization’s communications and usage patterns—limited understanding of the transactions that occur between an organization’s subjects, assets, applications, and services, and absence of the data necessary to identify these communications and their specific flows</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of information regarding everything that encompasses the organization’s attack surface. Organizations can usually address threats with traditional security tools in the layers that they currently manage and maintain such as networks and applications, but elements of a ZTA may extend beyond their normal purview. False assumptions are often made in understanding the health of a device as well as its exposure to supply chain risks.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Technical challenges, such as:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Integrating various types of commercially available technologies of varying maturities, assessing capabilities, and identifying technology gaps to build a complete ZTA</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of a standardized policy to distribute, manage, and enforce security policy, causing organizations to face either a fragmentary policy environment or non-interoperable components</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of common understanding and language of ZTA across the community and within the organization, gauging the organization’s ZTA maturity, determining which ZTA approach is most suitable for the business, and developing an implementation plan</p></li>
<li><p>There is not a single ZTA that fits all. ZTAs need to be designed and integrated for each organization based on the organization’s requirements and risk tolerance, as well as its existing invested technologies and environments.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<section id="project-approach">
<h2>Project Approach<a class="headerlink" href="#project-approach" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This project began with a clean laboratory environment that we populated with various applications and services that would be expected in a typical enterprise to create several baseline enterprise architectures. Examples include SIEMs, vulnerability scanning and assessment tools, security validation tools, and discovery tools.</p>
<p>Next, we used a phased approach to develop example ZTA solutions. This approach was designed to represent how we believe most enterprises will evolve their enterprise architecture toward ZTA, i.e., by starting with their already-existing enterprise environment and gradually adding or adapting capabilities. Our first implementations with minimum viable solution were EIG deployments because the identity-based controls provided by EIG are foundational components of ZTA. We called this phase of the project the EIG crawl phase, which did not include cloud capabilities, and followed by the EIG run phase, which we added cloud capabilities.</p>
<p>We gradually deployed additional functional components and capabilities to address an increasing number of ZTA requirements and deployed microsegmentation, SDP, and SASE approaches.</p>
<p>Given the importance of discovery to the successful implementation of a ZTA, we initially deployed it to continuously observe the environment and use those observations to audit and validate the documented baseline map on an ongoing basis. Because we had instantiated the baseline environment ourselves, we already had a good initial understanding of it. However, we were able to use the discovery tools to audit and validate what we deployed and provisioned, correlate known data with information reported by the tools, and use the tool outputs to formulate initial zero trust policy, ultimately ensuring that observed network flows correlate to static policies.</p>
<p>As we continue to develop additional ZTA builds, we do so with the understanding that there is no single approach for migrating to ZTA that is best for all enterprises and the recognition that ZTA is a set of concepts and principles, not a set of technical specifications that can be complied with. The objective, instead, is continuous improvement of access control processes and policies in accordance with the principles of ZTA.</p>

<section id="broadcom-vmware">
<h3>Broadcom (VMware)<a class="headerlink" href="#broadcom-vmware" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Enabling secure work from anywhere is a critical requirement for most businesses, and a zero trust architecture is best suited to enable that. But zero trust is not a single product; rather, it is a solution that requires visibility and control at the various points that link a user with the resources they need. The VMware Anywhere Workspace is designed for zero trust with connected control points for devices, users, networks, and applications.</p>
<p>Note that after the VMware products were implemented at NCCoE, VMware was acquired by Broadcom.</p>
<section id="securing-devices">
<h4>Securing Devices<a class="headerlink" href="#securing-devices" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The foundation of trust is the posture of devices used by users to access applications and resources. VMware Workspace ONE™ enables customers to manage the configuration and posture of any device. Via the Compliance engine in Workspace ONE, policies are created using a customer-selectable set of attributes and configurations. Minimum posture requirements for application access can be defined for any device, whether managed by Workspace ONE or not. To limit the on-device software footprint for personally owned devices, Workspace ONE Mobile Application Management (MAM) capabilities can provide posture assessment and compliance within applications such as Workspace ONE Tunnel, Boxer, and Web, as well as for customer-developed applications. With the addition of endpoint security solutions such as Workspace ONE Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) and Carbon Black Cloud, advanced security can be implemented to ensure the device is trustworthy; and out-of-compliance devices can trigger response and remediation via Workspace ONE UEM. Integrations with other leading endpoint and network security solutions also are made possible through Workspace ONE Trust Network, where threat signals are used to inform and influence device posture assessments and trigger remediation and response.</p>
</section>
<section id="secure-identities">
<h4>Secure Identities<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-identities" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>User identity, posture, and behavior are also critical to zero trust. Workspace ONE Access integrates seamlessly with leading identity providers and layers on a rich set of controls that provide conditional access to any application or resource while delivering an optimal end user experience. Workspace ONE Access integrates with user, device, and login risk analytics provided by Workspace ONE Intelligence, thereby adding behavioral context to conditional application access policies and in case of established trust, granting passwordless SSP based access to applications and resources. Adoption of zero trust solutions including MFA is eased with choices including integrations for third party FIDO2 authentications or the use of phishing resistant multi-factor authentication client included with Workspace ONE Intelligent Hub.</p>
</section>
<section id="secure-network-connectivity">
<h4>Secure Network Connectivity<a class="headerlink" href="#secure-network-connectivity" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Providing secure connectivity to resources, regardless of location, in an efficient and safe manner is critical to zero trust. With Zero Trust Network Access, which VMware delivers with Workspace ONE Tunnel and Secure Access, companies can tailor access based on resource sensitivity, device posture, user role, and authentication strength, as well as the application being used to access the network. VMware is unique in providing per-app tunneling capabilities for both managed and unmanaged devices, meaning that access to a resource can be allowed only via specified applications (e.g. Chrome, Firefox or a native client application). Traffic policies can be sculpted to provide different access to each application. With Tunnel, a device is not placed onto a network or given an internal IP address, which further minimizes network-borne threats to endpoints, and the security risks of hub-based network architectures. Secure access can be provided as either a managed service from VMware or with the customer-deployed Unified Access Gateway (UAG). Integrating with NSX can further segment access by limiting access to NSX Security Groups to specific applications managed by Workspace ONE.</p>
<p>In addition to Workspace ONE Tunnel and Secure Access, VMware Horizon also provides secure access to virtual desktops and applications that run inside your data center, which also provides complete data containerization.</p>
</section>
<section id="application-workload">
<h4>Application Workload<a class="headerlink" href="#application-workload" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>VMware vSphere provides workload isolation through virtualization. VMware NSX secures access to workloads by providing microsegmentation within the data center, which provides granular access policies that allow traffic only between specific resources. The deep integration between vSphere, NSX, and Carbon Black Cloud, allows for security to be further improved by restricting communication between specific processes between disparate workloads, thus ensuring that only traffic between processes and workloads that is specifically intended is permitted.</p>
<p>NSX provides additional east-west (intra-data center) inspection of traffic, including IDS/IPS capabilities, Network Traffic Analytics (NTA), and Network Detection and Response (NDR), which provide advanced threat protection against advanced threats and lateral movement.</p>
</section>
<section id="data">
<h4>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#data" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>VMware Workspace ONE Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) is responsible for device enrollment, a mobile application catalog, policy enforcement regarding device compliance, and integration with key enterprise services, such as email, content, and social media.</p>
<p>Workspace ONE UEM features include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Device management platform - Allows full lifecycle management of a wide variety of devices, including phones, tablets, Windows 10, and rugged and special-purpose devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Application deployment capabilities - Provides automatic deployment or self-service application access for employees.</p></li>
<li><p>User and device profile services - Ensures that configuration settings for users and devices comply with enterprise security requirements and simplify end-user access to applications</p></li>
<li><p>Productivity tools - Includes an email client with secure email functionality, a content management tool for securely storing and managing content, and a web browser to ensure secure access to corporate information and tools.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="visibility-and-analytics">
<h4>Visibility and Analytics<a class="headerlink" href="#visibility-and-analytics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Having visibility into the operation of the zero trust solution requires bringing together data from many solution elements. Additionally, bringing data together can enable analysis and generation of insights that can inform a ZTA.</p>
<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence provides visibility and analytics for device, identity, and network activities and highlights conditions that deviate significantly from the norm. Enterprises now can see how devices compare to their enterprise fleet, and these insights can be used for reporting and visualization and as input to automated response actions and playbooks. Resource access attempts can be profiled to look for new or unusual access patterns, and that information can be used to directly inform zero trust access policies.</p>
<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence can incorporate threat data from leading security providers via Workspace ONE Trust Network, which gives additional context and insights that administrators can use to assess hygiene and posture.</p>
</section>
<section id="automation-and-orchestration">
<h4>Automation and Orchestration<a class="headerlink" href="#automation-and-orchestration" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Workspace ONE Intelligence provides automation and orchestration capabilities that can be triggered by any event. Automations can be as simple as notifying a user that their device needs an operating system (OS) update to remain compliant, or complex actions that involve multiple products, such as responding to detected malicious code on a device by opening a ticket in a ticketing system, then notifying IT and security teams, removing sensitive enterprise applications and data, followed by quarantining the device from the network. This is all made possible through API integrations with VMware and third-party products and is enabled in a low- or no-code manner.</p>
<p>VMware’s product offerings provide the foundation for ZTA.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Connected control points - device, user, network, and workload</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom of choice - any device, any application, any cloud</p></li>
<li><p>Respecting privacy - clearly communicate what data the enterprise can - and cannot - see</p></li>
<li><p>End-user experience - better security delivered in a way that improves user experience</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Mandiant Security Validation (MSV)<a class="headerlink" href="#mandiant-security-validation-msv" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Mandiant Security Validation (MSV), continuously informed by Mandiant frontline intelligence on the latest attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), automates a testing program that gives real data on how security controls are performing. This solution provides visibility and evidence on the status of security controls’ effectiveness against adversary threats targeting organizations and data to optimize the environment against relevant threats. MSV can provide many benefits to an organization (for example, identify limitations in current cybersecurity stack, evaluate proposed cybersecurity tools for an organization, determine overlapping controls, automate assessment actions, and train cybersecurity operators). To support these use cases, MSV emulates attackers to safely process advanced cyberattack security content within production environments. It is designed so defenses respond to it as if an attack is taking place across the most critical areas of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Using the natural design of the Security Validation platform, Mandiant is able to support the project in testing and documenting the outcome of one of the key tenets of ZTA, “The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and associated resources.” To do this, the software produces quantifiable evidence that shows how people, processes, and technologies perform when specific malicious behaviors are encountered, such as attacks by a specific threat actor or attack vector.</p>
<p>The core Validation components of the MSV platform are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Director - This is the main component of the platform and provides the following functionality:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Acts as the Integration point and content manager for the SIEM and other components of the security stack</p></li>
<li><p>Hosts the Content Library (Actions, Sequences, Evaluations, and Files) used for testing security controls</p></li>
<li><p>Manages the Actor assignment during testing</p></li>
<li><p>Aggregates testing results and facilitates report creation</p></li>
<li><p>Maintains connections with the Mandiant Updater and Content Services, allowing updates to be received automatically for the platform and its content</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Actors (also referred to as flex, Endpoint, and Network Actors) - The components that safely perform tests in production environments. Specifically, use these to verify the configuration and test the effectiveness of network security controls; Windows, Mac, and Linux endpoint controls; and email controls.</p></li>
<li><p>Cloud controls</p></li>
<li><p>Policy compliance</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Director is the component that receives the information from the systems in the environment based on an integration with a SIEM and/or directly with the security appliance itself. Tests are run between Actors and not directly on systems in the environment.</p>

<h3>Palo Alto Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#palo-alto-networks" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Palo Alto Networks is shaping the cloud-centric future with technology designed to transform the way people and organizations operate by using the latest breakthroughs in AI, analytics, automation, and orchestration. By delivering an integrated platform and empowering a growing ecosystem of partners, Palo Alto Networks security technologies enable organizations to apply consistent security controls across clouds, networks, endpoints, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Their core capabilities include the ability to inspect all traffic, including all applications, threats, and content, and tie that traffic to the user, regardless of location or device type. The user, application, and content—the elements that run your business—become integral components of your enterprise’s zero trust security policy.</p>
<p>Towards that end, their Next Generation Firewall (including all hardware-based, VM, and containerized form factors) and Prisma Access have consistent core capabilities fundamental for zero trust policy enforcement—including User-ID, App-ID, and Device-ID.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>User-ID</em>™ technology enables organizations to identify users in all locations, no matter their device type or OS. Visibility into application activity—based on users and groups, instead of IP addresses—safely enables applications by aligning usage with business requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><em>App-ID</em>™ technology enables organizations to accurately identify applications in all traffic passing through the network, including applications disguised as authorized traffic, using dynamic ports, or trying to hide under the veil of encryption. App-ID allows organizations to understand and control applications and their functions, such as video streaming versus chat, upload versus download, and screen-sharing versus remote device control.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Device-ID</em>™ technology enables organizations to enforce policy rules based on a device, regardless of changes to its IP address or location. By providing traceability for devices and associating network events with specific devices, Device-ID allows organizations to gain context for how events relate to devices and write policies that are associated with devices, instead of users, locations, or IP addresses, which can change over time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All NGFW form factors and Prisma Access also include the following cloud-delivered security service (CDSS) capabilities: Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP), Wildfire (WF) malware analysis, Advanced URL Filtering (AURL), and DNS Security (DNS). These capabilities are supported by the GlobalProtect (GP) remote access solution and can all be centrally managed by Panorama.</p>
<section id="next-generation-firewall-ngfw">
<h4>Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)<a class="headerlink" href="#next-generation-firewall-ngfw" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) is a machine learning (ML) powered network security platform available in physical, virtual, containerized, and cloud-delivered form factors—all managed centrally via Panorama. The Palo Alto Networks NGFWs inspect all traffic, including all applications, threats, and content, and tie that traffic to the user, regardless of location or device type. Built on a single-pass architecture, the Palo Alto Networks NGFW performs full-stack, single-pass inspection of all traffic across all ports, providing complete context around the application, associated content, and user identity to form the basis for zero trust security policy decisions.</p>
<p>Additional NGFWs, including cloud-delivered, software-based VMs (VM-Series), and container-based (CN-Series), are anticipated to be used as part of the microsegmentation deployment model phase of this project, deployed as PEPs deeper within each enterprise environment. Regardless of form factor, any NGFW or Prisma Access instance can serve as a PEP, enabled by the core (User-ID, Application-ID, Device-ID) technologies described above—helping organizations achieve common zero trust use cases such as data center segmentation, user or application-based segmentation, or cloud transformation.</p>

<h3>PC Matic<a class="headerlink" href="#pc-matic" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>PC Matic is an endpoint protection solution for enterprises of all sizes, utilizing PC Matic’s proactive application allowlisting technology. Through a series of global and local allowlists, PC Matic’s software asset management restricts unauthorized programs and processes from accessing resources such as data or services on a network. Unlike traditional application allowlisting products that solely rely on self-made local allowlists, PC Matic operates off both the user’s local list and a real-time automated global allowlist consisting of verified files, processes, digital certificates, and scripts. PC Matic eliminates governance issues by granting users the ability to create application, digital certificate, directory, or scripting policies within their local lists. This capability takes immediate effect and can be deployed to individual endpoints, departments, groups, whole organizations, and all agencies and enterprises managed across the account.</p>
<section id="pc-matic-pro">
<h4>PC Matic Pro<a class="headerlink" href="#pc-matic-pro" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>PC Matic Pro’s on-premises endpoint protection provides default-deny protection at the device. PC Matic Pro monitors for any process that attempts to execute and automatically denies access to any unauthorized or known malicious entities. When the unauthorized files and/or processes are denied access, all metadata pertaining to the block is then communicated to the architecture’s SIEM for prioritizing and further investigation. This integration provides users with increased visibility over their managed devices and networks. If a block is verified and warranted, the SIEM of choice can utilize the policy engine from either PC Matic or a third-party vendor to create and enforce the exception, granting immediate access to the desired deployment. PC Matic’s real-time policy offerings eliminate governance issues, take immediate effect without delay or issue, and provide users with streamlined management across their managed architectures. PC Matic’s allow-by-exception approach to prevention enhances the zero trust model and minimizes the network’s attack surface by ensuring only authorized processes are granted privileges to execute and proceed further.</p>

<h4>Full Remote Browser Isolation<a class="headerlink" href="#full-remote-browser-isolation" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>Remote browser isolation enables organizations to fully contain web applications within a secure container to prevent malware and data leakage and provide complete control over a browser session. The Skyhigh SSE solution out of the box offers remote browser isolation for risky websites to ensure no implicit trust is being granted to web applications prior to trust validation. In some cases, organizations would choose that no implicit trust is ever extended to web traffic, regardless of known reputation. In this scenario, full-time browser isolation is required to meet this objective. The Trellix offering, with sister company Skyhigh Security, includes the ability for full remote browser isolation as an add-on module. For more information on remote browser isolation, see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/remote-browser-isolation.html">Remote Browser Isolation | McAfee Products</a>.</p>

<h4>Helix (XDR)<a class="headerlink" href="#helix-xdr" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>To achieve zero trust outcomes, it is necessary to have a common platform that applies AI-driven, real-time threat intelligence to data collected from devices and security sensors as a mechanism for surfacing advanced attacks and associated entity risk, and to orchestrate proactive and remediating responses across native and open security tools. Within many zero trust reference architectures, this platform could be considered the dynamic access control plane, or the trust algorithm.</p>
<p>Trellix delivers this capability through Helix. Helix is a cloud-hosted, intelligence-driven platform that collects data from over 600 different sensors and point solutions, analyzes the data against known threats, behaviors, and campaigns using AI and enhanced detection rules, and powers automated and manual responses across Trellix native and third-party policy engines.

<h4>CloudVisory<a class="headerlink" href="#cloudvisory" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>It’s no secret that cloud services are now pervasive; many applications have been moved either through SaaS or cloud services development to cloud data centers. This presents new challenges for many organizations as they work to gain better visibility and control over IaaS-hosted cloud applications and the thousands of microservices that support them. As organizations look to adopt zero trust principles within the cloud, it will become imperative that proper service configuration, IAM roles, cloud network traffic, and workloads are fully evaluated for risk and protected. CloudVisory supports these objectives through:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>CI/CD integration to ensure proper service configuration, and continuous posture assessments to guard against configuration drift</p></li>
<li><p>IAM policy inspection</p></li>
<li><p>intelligent network microsegmentation</p></li>
<li><p>intra-cloud and cloud-to-cloud network monitoring</p></li>
<li><p>multi-cloud support</p></li>
</ul>
