<p>Table 7 lists the full demonstration results for SDP, and Microsegmentation demonstrations run in Enterprise 4 Build 4 (E4B4). The technology deployed in E4B4 was able to determine endpoint compliance for Windows, macOS, Linux and mobile devices and prevent noncompliant endpoints from accessing private resources. Note that after this build was completed, VMware was acquired by Broadcom.</p>
