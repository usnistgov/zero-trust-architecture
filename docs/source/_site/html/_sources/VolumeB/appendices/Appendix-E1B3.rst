Enterprise 1 Build 3 (E1B3) - SDP - Zscaler ZPA CA as PE
========================================================

.. include:: /_publication_note.rst

E1B3 uses all of the same products and technologies as E1B2, and the architecture of E1B3 is the same as the architecture of E1B2. (See :ref:`Enterprise 1 Build 2 (E1B2) - EIG Run - Zscaler ZPA Central Authority (CA) as PE`)

The difference between E1B3 and E1B2 is that some modifications were made to Zscaler configurations and parameters to enable E1B3 to perform additional use cases that were defined for demonstration purposes after E1B2 was completed. These modifications were as follows:

-  altering ZCC re-authentication time limits

-  modifications to some policies to demonstrate new use cases

Some use cases in :ref:`functional demonstrations`, including Confidence Level and Service-to-Service Interactions were not demonstrated due to products that were unavailable for the build. These tools included Deception, Zscaler for Workloads, and Cloud Browser Isolation.
