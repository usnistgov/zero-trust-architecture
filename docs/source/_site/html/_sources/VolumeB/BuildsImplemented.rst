Builds Implemented
====================

.. include:: /_publication_note.rst

The following is a list of the builds that have been implemented in the project, organized by build type. Each of these builds instantiates the ZTA architecture in a unique way, depending on the equipment used and the capabilities supported. The products used in each build were based on having out-of-box integration. Note that after the VMware products were implemented at NCCoE, VMware was acquired by Broadcom.
